# Features of Weather App

1. It uses a Google Api for accessing the longitudes and latitudes of the location entered. However, the google api that appears in this code
   is changes due to security reasons. So you have to make you own account for accesssing the data.

Google API - https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/

2. It uses OpenWeatherMap api for accessing weather data of particular region. I have used current Weather api as it was free, while others
   comes in premium. Similar case, the api appeared in this code is changed for security purpose.

OpenWeatherMap - https://openweathermap.org/api

3. It changes the background color based on day and night. In the update i will be including the change in background color based on the type
of weather such as rain, cloud etc
